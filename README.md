bingo
=====

Get a 2D array filled with bingo numbers.  This is probably the most complex
and useful thing I have ever written.

Usage
-----
```python
In [1]: from bingo import make_board

In [2]: make_board()
Out[2]:
[[8, 25, 31, 59, 71],
 [7, 17, 36, 48, 63],
 [9, 21, '', 60, 73],
 [15, 16, 38, 51, 62],
 [14, 22, 41, 55, 67]]
```
Or from the command line:
```bash
code/bingo$ python bingo.py
[[5, 24, 39, 57, 72],
 [3, 19, 34, 49, 71],
 [15, 28, '', 46, 66],
 [10, 29, 32, 53, 75],
 [9, 17, 37, 52, 73]]
```
